# build-small-websites-and-learn-coding
This shall be a guide on how to start learning – as a designer without coding skills – how to build small and simple websites with minimal configuration effort and low to no maintenance, based on hosted services.

The plan is to develop a micro-curriculum as a guide, so you can start learning instantly.

I see the timely horizon somehwere around a year when you do it besides your fulltime employment and having children too maybe. The more time you can invest, the faster you will be.

**Mind: This is only draft status and – because written from memory – needs proof of concept and feedback. It is meant to grow over time.**

In the following I just jot from memory how I would approach the topic today.

Scope is small simple websites with basic functionality. Setup, domain configuration and maintenance should be as simple and automated as possible. Theme adjustment should be possible with some HTML and CSS.

I believe to accomplish this, one needs basic to good skills in HTML and CSS and maybe a bit of JS. And of course platform specific knowledge about configuration of the hosted CMS and the theme framework.

This guide does not cover: Information architecture, branding, content strategy and user interface and user experience design (which will be necessary of course to create successful websites).

To know where to go it might be useful to create a fictional client project with a project name and some branding so the project is real and fun for you. Set a S.M.A.R.T. goal in the beginning so you can measure your success afterwards. Something that can go live as an MVP as fast as possible and can you build up skills as you go and implement different features one by one. This also serves as a tangible outcome and a kind of portfolio site afterwards. A personal side project.

## Find here possible client requirements (or wishes) that can occur in any combination (not complete I guess)

* Domain order and connection, possibly configuration (subdomains, subfolders etc.)
* Information architecture (page structure, header, content and/or footer menu)
* Content maintenance or training so customers can do it themselves. (Otherwise: Service contract! Or on the hour to help on demand with clear pricing!)
* Setup email addresses + mailboxes + redirects
* Integration of web fonts (Google fonts) for typographic design
* Theme customization (with HTML, CSS, possibly JS and even some PHP, at least in the case of Wordpress)

* Large hero image stage in the page header
* Protect pages with password
* Download area, media gallery
* Newsletter registration and setup / connection mailing list (Mailchimp, Cleverreach)
* Mini shop with payment or paid downloads (Stripe or Paypal or similar)
* Connection table reservation (e.g. OpenTable)
* Website Analytics (Google Analytics, Google Lighthouse)
* Google Maps with location picker
* Social media connection (Sharelinks: facebook, twitter, instagram, G +)
* Search
* Multilanguage content
* Basic SEO (Google Webmaster Tools)
* Basic SEA (Google AdWords)
* Content: Imprint and privacy issues (DSGVO / GDPR), cookies etc.
* ...
 
## Learning streams
* HTML + CSS (+ possibly JS) learn to customize Themes / Templates
* Learn how to handle (specific) website building / hosted CMS and map all other project requirements
* Handling third-party tools (GA etc.)
* Additional tech config know-how
