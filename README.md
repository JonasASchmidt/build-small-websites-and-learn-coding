# build-small-websites-and-learn-coding

This shall be a guide on how to start learning how to build small and simple websites with minimal configuration effort and low to no maintenance, based on hosted services. Also you will need to learn HTML & CSS and maybe some JS in order to know what you're doing and adapt website themes to your liking.

I see the timely horizon somewhere around a year when you do it besides your full time employment and having children too maybe. The more time you can invest, the faster you will be.

**Mind: This is only draft status and – because written from memory – needs proof of concept and feedback. It is meant to grow over time.**

In the following I just jot from memory how I would approach the topic today. 

Basic principle in all of this: Do stuff and break things. Learn by trying and asking and trying again. Ask support, tutors, buddies, mentors, whoever. Build a process and document your knowledge.

Scope is small simple websites with basic functionality. Setup, domain configuration and maintenance should be as simple and automated as possible. Theme adjustment should be possible with some HTML and CSS.

I believe to accomplish this, one needs basic to good skills in HTML and CSS and maybe a bit of JS. And of course platform specific knowledge about configuration of the hosted CMS and the theme framework. Also some administrative knowledge about 

This guide does not cover: Information architecture, branding, content strategy and user interface and user experience design (which will be necessary of course to create successful websites).

To know where to go it might be useful to create a fictional client project with a project name and some branding so the project is real and fun for you. Set a S.M.A.R.T. goal in the beginning so you can measure your success afterwards. Something that can go live as an MVP as fast as possible and can you build up skills as you go and implement different features one by one. This also serves as a tangible outcome and a kind of portfolio site afterwards. A personal side project.
